RamanD2O incorporates three smoothing methods: LOESS: LOESS (locally weighted smoothing), non-parametric strategies fitting smooth curve data points. SG: Savitzky–Golay (SG) filtering, widely used method, involves local least-squares fitting data using polynomials. commonly employed smoothing data calculating derivatives noisy datasets. EMD: Denoising empirical mode decomposition (EMD) thresholding. Please refer emddenoise detailed descriptions. Caution: time-consuming!!! Baseline Two methods baseline removal implemented RamanD2O. polyfit: Polynomial baseline fitting. please refer spc_fit_poly spc_fit_poly detailed descriptions. als: Asymmetric Least Squares. please refer baseline.als detailed descriptions. Notes: Following baseline removal, Raman intensities may exhibit negative values. negative values can reset zero selecting “Set zero”, entire Raman spectra can vertically adjusted choosing “Pull ”.
