\title{Evaluate the importance of variables in O2PLS models}
\usage{
O2PLSvip(x, y, model)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Training data of sequence features' relative abundances.
Must have the exact same rows (subjects/samples) as \code{y}.}

\item{y}{Training data of metabolite relative abundances.
Must have the exact same rows (subjects/samples) as \code{x}.}

\item{model}{List of class \code{"o2m"}. \code{x}
and \code{y} must be the corresponding training data.}
}
\value{
A list containing
    \item{xvip}{For the X-block, the VIP profiles for the predictive part of
    the model, the orthogonal part, the total model.}
    \item{yvip}{For the Y-block, the VIP profiles for the predictive part of
    the model, the orthogonal part, the total model.}
}
\description{
O2PLS-VIP, an approach for variable influence on projection (VIP) in O2PLS
models, is a model-based method for judging the importance of variables. For
both X and Y data blocks, it generates VIP profiles for (i) the predictive
part of the model, (ii) the orthogonal part, and (iii) the total model.
}
\details{
It generates 6 VIPO2PLS profiles in total:
1) Two VIP profiles for the predictive components, which uncover the X- and
Y-variables that are more important for the model interpretation in relation
to the variation correlated to the Y- and X- data matrices respectively;
2) Two VIP profiles for the orthogonal components for both the X-block and
the Y-block severally, profiles that uncover the X- and Y- variables that are
more relevant in relation to the variation uncorrelated to the Y- and X- data
matrices respectively;
3) Two VIP profiles for the total model (i.e. including the contributions of
both predictive and orthogonal components) for both the X- and the Y- blocks
severally, these VIP profiles point at the X- and Y- variables that are more
significant for the whole model.
